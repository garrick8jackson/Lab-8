In my attacker virtual machine I ran a brute force simulator code that attempted to log into my windows account 11 times. After this I logged the actions to get an understanding of when, where, and who was trying to login to my windows virtual machine.

On my windows virtual machine I ran a malware generator code in powershell ISE to create malware and see the response of the system. After this I logged the actions to see the given information of what malware it was, and when it attempted to access my windows virtual machine.
